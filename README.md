# LearningGithub001
This repository contains my work from the LinkedIn Learning course "Learning GitHub."

This line is an edit made to the code created in a branch of it on my computer, which was not origionally there. This was made using the terminal. 

This is a second line which is being written from GitHub Desktop, using Visual Studio Code to edit the README file again.
