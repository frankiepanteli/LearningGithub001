# LearningGithub001
This repository contains my work from the LinkedIn Learning course "Learning GitHub." This was a video course with excercises covering GitHub fundamentals. More information about the contents of this can be found in my notes (CourseNotes_Learning GitHub.txt), a copy of which is found in each of three separate repos where the course excercised have been completed (LearningGithub001, LearningGithub002 and LearningGithub003).

This line is an edit made to the code created in a branch of it on my computer, which was not origionally there. This was made using the terminal. 

This is a second line which is being written from GitHub Desktop, using Visual Studio Code to edit the README file again.
