# LearningGithub001
This repository contains my work from the LinkedIn Learning course "Learning GitHub." This was a video course with excercises covering GitHub fundamentals - more information about the contents of this can be found in my notes.

This line is an edit made to the code created in a branch of it on my computer, which was not origionally there. This was made using the terminal. 

This is a second line which is being written from GitHub Desktop, using Visual Studio Code to edit the README file again.
